%how is this done? 
%We could extract max and min amplitude, then length of up stroke, length
%of down stroke. Perform a mean2error computation. All distances treated
%equal so may have to account for that...

%Perform PCA?

%1) Calculate Covariance matrix of signal cov(a)
%2) Find eigenvalues of covariance matrix. Order these in magnitude order.
%These are your principle components.
